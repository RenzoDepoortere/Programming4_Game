# Goal
The goal of the final assignement of this course was to recreate a retro game using our own little engine.
We received a very bare bone starting template and during the semester we would improve it bit by bit using the 
the things we learned in class.

# Dig Dug
The game that was assigned to me was Dig Dug, a 2D grid-based game where the player would have to eradicate all the monsters
lurking underneath the ground. To do this the player digs though the dirt and blows up the enemies using a little pump.
